List of Prohibited Items for International Express"></a>1. List of Prohibited Items for International Express</h3><ul>
<li><p>Dangerous goods: Including inflammable and explosive items (such as firecrackers, gasoline, alcohol), corrosive items (such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid), radioactive items, compressed gases (such as lighter gas, oxygen cylinders), etc. These items are prone to causing safety accidents during transportation and are strictly prohibited from being mailed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Contraband items: Covering drugs, firearms and ammunition, controlled knives, pornographic items, counterfeit currencies, etc., which are explicitly prohibited from circulation and transportation by law.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Restricted items: Some countries have restrictive regulations on food (especially meat, fruits), medicines, animal and plant products, cultural and artistic relics, etc. Before mailing, it is necessary to check the specific requirements of the destination country to avoid items being detained or destroyed due to violations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-International-Express-Packaging-Guidelines"><a href="#2-International-Express-Packaging-Guidelines" class="headerlink" title="2. International Express Packaging Guidelines"></a>2. International Express Packaging Guidelines</h3><ul>
<li><p>Ordinary items: Choose a sturdy carton. After putting the items in, fill them with cushioning materials (such as bubble wrap, foam particles) to ensure that the items do not shake. Reinforce the outside of the carton with tape in a criss - cross pattern to prevent cracking during transportation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fragile items: For glass products, ceramics, etc., first wrap them with foam pads or bubble wrap for multiple layers, then put them into customized foam molds or cartons. Fill the gaps with soft fillers, and mark the “fragile” sign on the outside of the box.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Liquid items: Seal them in leak - proof containers. The capacity of each container should not be too large. Wrap the outside with a plastic bag and tie it tightly, then put it into a carton. Wrap the surrounding area with hygroscopic materials to prevent leakage from polluting other items.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Valuable items: Use anti - pressure and anti - shock special packaging, and can be equipped with a wooden frame. At the same time, mark “valuable items” on the outside of the packaging, and it is recommended to insure them.</p>
</li>
</ul>

Essential Knowledge for International Express Customs Clearance"></a>3. Essential Knowledge for International Express Customs Clearance</h3><ul>
<li><p>Required documents: Generally including commercial invoices (which need to indicate the name, quantity, value, purpose of the items, etc.), packing lists (detailed listing of the items in the package), and some items also need to provide certificates of origin, health quarantine certificates, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Declaration requirements: truthfully declare item information, including name, quantity, value, etc. The deviation between the declared value and the actual value should not be too large, otherwise, it may be fined or detained by the customs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Customs clearance process: After the items arrive in the destination country, the customs will inspect the items, check whether the declared information is consistent with the actual items. If the inspection is passed, they will be released; otherwise, they may be required to supplement documents, or conduct taxation, return, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Characteristics of customs clearance in various countries: The efficiency and strictness of customs clearance vary from country to country. For example, customs clearance in the United States is relatively efficient, but the supervision of food and drugs is stricter; customs clearance procedures in Brazil are complex and prone to delays, so preparations should be made in advance.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li><p>Weight calculation: Divided into actual weight and volumetric weight. Volumetric weight &#x3D; length × width × height (cm) ÷ 5000 (some express companies calculate by 6000). The larger of the two is taken as the charging weight.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Basic fee: Determined according to the charging weight and the destination country&#x2F;region. Different express companies have different rates. Generally, the farther the distance and the larger the weight, the higher the fee.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Surcharges: Including fuel surcharge (fluctuating with fuel prices), remote area surcharge (additional payment for shipping to remote areas), overweight and oversize surcharge (items whose weight or size exceeds the specified standards), etc.</p>

</li>
</ul>
